📊 About the Dataset – MNIST Handwritten Digits (CSV Format)

✍️ Context
The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision 🧠👁️.
It contains thousands of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), and the goal is to build models that can recognize and classify them accurately.
This version of the dataset is formatted in CSV, making it easy to load and use with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, or TensorFlow (with slight reshaping).]
  Content
Each row in the CSV represents one image, flattened into a row of 784 pixel values (28×28), along with a label indicating the digit.

Total samples: 🧾 60,000 images

🏋️‍♂️ 42,000 for training

🧪 18,000 for testing

Column Descriptions
🏷️ label: The digit that the image represents (0 to 9) – this is the target variable

🟦 pixel0 to pixel783: Each column corresponds to a grayscale pixel value (0–255)
  - The image is originally 28×28, flattened into a single row
  - 0 = white (background), 255 = black (ink/digit)

  🎯 Target Variable
label: Represents the digit written in the image (0–9)

 Use Cases
The MNIST dataset is widely used for:

🔤 Image classification with ML/DL models

🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

📉 Model evaluation (accuracy)

🔍 Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA 

✅ I have personally used this dataset to implement and analyze Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualizing and reducing high-dimensional image data.
